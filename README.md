I love Home Assistant. I don't love configuring dashboards.

Stuga is what I wanted: a fast, polished app that just works. Open it, log in, done. Your rooms, devices, and floors are already there. No YAML. No cards. No templates.

Built for my family to actually use.

## What it does

- **Zero config** — Reads your HA setup automatically
- **In-place editing** — Rename rooms, change icons, reorder things. All saved back to HA.
- **Mobile-first** — Designed for phones. Works on tablets and web too.
- **Fast** — WebSocket connection, instant updates
